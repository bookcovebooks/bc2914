## About This Book

On a moonlit hillside at the edge of the wilderness, Bill—a powerful
mongrel sheepdog with wolf blood in his veins—stands guard over his
master’s flock. Bound by fierce loyalty yet haunted by an inherited
hunger for the kill, Bill lives in constant tension between duty and
instinct. When danger comes in the night and blood is spilled, his
restraint is tested as never before. This quiet, gripping tale explores
devotion, trust, and the thin, perilous line between civilization and
the wild that still glimmers in a dog’s eyes.
